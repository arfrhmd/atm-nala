## Simple ATM Project

> _This project was created for educational purpose._

## About

**NALA** stands for **N**issa (Anissa), **A**ldi, **L**idya, and **A**rif. (the creators)

In its creation, NALA ATM utilizes MySQL technology to manage the database. Furthermore, NALA ATM also incorporates several validations similar to regular ATMs.

There are still many shortcomings in the development of this project due to the tight deadline and insufficient knowledge. I hope this will help you in building a simple project using the Python programming language.
